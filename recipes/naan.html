    <h2><p>What Is Naan?</p></h2>

        <div class="description"><p>Naan (pronounced nahn) is an oven-baked, leavened
            that is stuffed and flavored in a variety of ways. An
            essential part of South and Central Asian cuisine, naan is
            easy, affordable, and makes the most of pantry
            ingredients you already have on hand.</p>

        <p>Flour, yeast, milk, and butter make a tender dough that's
            simply seasoned with garlic and salt, but there is a wide
            array of naan bread flavors. You'll find everything from
            coconut and raisin-stuffed bread to saucy lamb-topped
            naan in restaurants and home kitchens around the world.</p></div>
            
    
    <h2><p>Ingredients</p></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
            <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        </ul>


    <h2><p>Steps</p></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand
                about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix
                in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 
                to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth,
                 and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and
                 knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about
                  the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14.
                   Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with 
                   a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
            <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
            <li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces
                 of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy 
                 and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked 
                 sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from
                  the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
